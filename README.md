##📊 Qubot - AI-Powered Trading Assistant
Empowering beginner traders with AI-driven insights and intuitive visualizations 

Qubot is an AI-powered trading assistant designed to help novice investors make informed, data-driven decisions. By combining deep learning models (like LSTM and CNN) with LLMs (Large Language Models), we provide users with real-time stock trend analysis, predictions, and plain-language explanations—without requiring prior financial expertise.

✨ Project Overview
Manual trading can be slow, error-prone, and influenced by emotional biases. Our goal is to build a transparent, user-centric platform that leverages AI to improve decision-making accuracy while keeping the user in control.

Our system follows a human-in-the-loop approach , where AI handles complex data analysis, but users retain full authority over trade execution. This empowers traders with insights while reducing emotional bias and costly mistakes.

We aim to democratize access to advanced trading tools and foster a more educated, confident generation of traders.
